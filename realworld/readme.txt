	• priors_count: total number of non-juvenile criminal charges
	• charge_id: a numeric value corresponding to the specific criminal charge (see file CHARGE_ID)
	• charge_degree: a numeric indicator of the degree of the charge:
		• 0: misdemeanor
		• 1: felony
	• compas_decile_score: a numeric value between 1 and 10 corresponding to the recidivism risk score generated by COMPAS software (a small number corresponds to a low risk, a larger number corresponds to a high risk).
	• two_year_recid: a numeric indicator of whether the defendant recidivated two years after previous charge:
		• 0: no, did not recidivate
		• 1: yes, did recidivate
	• compas_prediction: a numeric value based on compas_decile_score, that make a binary recidivism prediction: 
		• 0 (will not recidivate): if compas_decile_score <= 4
		• 1 (will recidivate): if compas_decile_score > 4
	• compas_correct: a numeric value corresponding to whether the COMPAS prediction is correct or not:
		• 1: correct prediction
		• 0: incorrect prediction

• BROWARD_CLEAN_SUBSET: a subset of 1000 defendants extracted from BROWARD_CLEAN: these are the defendants used in our human assessment. 
	• block_num: a numeric value in the range 1 to 20 corresponding to which block each of the 1000 defendants were assigned (participants viewed only 1 subset of 50 defendants).
	• id: a unique identifier for each defendant (same as id in BROWARD_ORIGINAL)
	• race: a numeric indicator of race
		• 1: White (Caucasian); 2: Black (African American); 3: Hispanic; 4: Asian; 5: Native American; 6: Other
	• sex: a numeric indicator of sex
		• 0: male; 1: female
	• age
	• juv_fel_count: total number of juvenile felony criminal charges 
	• juv_ misd_count: total number of juvenile misdemeanor criminal charges 
	• priors_count: total number of non-juvenile criminal charges
	• charge_id: a numeric value corresponding to the specific criminal charge (see file CHARGE_ID)
	• charge_degree: a numeric indicator of the degree of the charge:
		• 0: misdemeanor
		• 1: felony
	• compas_decile_score: a numeric value between 1 and 10 corresponding to the recidivism risk score generated by COMPAS software (a small number corresponds to a low risk, a larger number corresponds to a high risk).
	• two_year_recid: a numeric indicator of whether the defendant recidivated two years after previous charge:
		• 0: no, did not recidivate
		• 1: yes, did recidivate

• MTURK_NO_RACE: this file is a 1000 x 400 block matrix. Each row corresponds to a defendant (index by the ID that can be found in BROWARD_CLEAN_SUBSET) and each column corresponds to one mechanical turk participant. The data is formatted as a block matrix because each participant viewed only 50 defendants. Each entry in this file corresponds to a correct (1) or incorrect (-1) recidivism prediction. A blank entry means that the participant did not respond to the corresponding defendant.

• MTURK_RACE: this file is the same as above, but for the condition in which race is specified.

• MTURK_NO_RACE_DEMOGRAPHICS: this data file provides the reported demographics of our participants in the no race condition. The columns correspond to:
	• mturk_code: a eight-digit code corresponding to a mechanical turk participant (these codes were generated randomly and cannot be used to identify any individual)
	• age: a numeric indicator of age:
		• 1: under the age of 18
		• 2: 18-24
		• 3: 25-34
		• 4: 35-44
		• 5: 45-54
		• 6: 55-64
		• 7: 65-74
		• 8: 75 or older
	• gender: a numeric indicator of gender
		• 0: male
		• 1: female
		• 2: preferred to describe
	• race: a numeric indicator of race (more than one option can be specified)
		• 1: White
		• 2: Black or African American
		• 3: Hispanic or Latino
		• 4: Asian
		• 5: American Indian or Alaska Native
		• 6: Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander
		• 7: Preferred to describe
	• education: a numeric indicator of education level
		• 1: less than a high school degree
		• 2: high school graduate (high school diploma or equivalent including GED)
		• 3: some college but no degree
		• 4: associate degree in college (2-year)
		• 5: bachelor’s degree (4-year)
		• 6: maserter’s degree
		• 7: doctoral degree
		• 8: professional degree

• MTURK_RACE_DEMOGRAPHICS: this data file provides the reported demographics of our participants in the race condition. The columns in this file are the same as in MTURK_NO_RACE_DEMOGRAPHICS.

• CHARGE_ID: for each charge_id in the file BROWARD_CLEAN, this data file provides the charge name. The columns correspond to:
	• charge_id: the charge_id (as found in BROWARD_CLEAN)
	• c_charge_desc: the charge name from BROWARD_ORIGINAL
	• mturk_charge_name: a simplified crime name that was presented to our mechanical turk participants

• MTURK_CHARGE_DESC: this data file provides the name and short charge description seen by our participants. The columns correspond to:
	• charge_id: a numeric value corresponding to the specific criminal charge (see file CHARGE_ID)
	• mturk_charge_name: a simplified crime name that was presented to our mechanical turk participants  (see file CHARGE_ID)
	• full_charge_description: a short description of the charge.
